# WP Valet Boilerplate

This is designed as a quick boilerplate for working in WordPress on Laravel Valet. This is fairly opinionated and that 
really comes down to the fact that this was designed to aid my own existing workflow instead of trying to support other 
people's preferences. Feel free to fork and mod to suit your own needs.
